I want you to create a tutorial


Here is the original plan but I want to change the focus

== First tutorial ==

1. Focus the first tutorial on core (but use Process)
 - serialization/deserialization
 - other 
 - Use Process to Demonstrate
2. Make the Original Plan tutorial2.py [do not use ipynb]
3. Let's mostly make the original plan tutorial 2

== File Creation ==
1. Output a .py file
2. Make interactive cells using # %%
3. Below the start of each section add 
 - # Markdown - if it is markdown, then add 
   """ """ below
 - # Python - if the section is Python code
4. Add to tutorials "tutorials/

The original plan said to use .ipynb. DO not do that.


== Example ==
# %%
# Markdown
"""
"""

# %%
# Python

<Python Code>

==ORIGINAL PLAN==
> I want to create tutorials for the framework.
   I first want to start with the base proc 
  (process). It should be a Jupyter Notebook 
  that gradually introduces concepts. Since the
   main purpose is for LLMs create an LLM 
  process. The first tutorial will introduce\
  \
  1. Process\
  2. AsyncProcess\
  3. StreamProcess\
  4. AsyncStreamProcess\
  \
  Do you have a good idea for how to create it?
   \
  \It's best to mark each step.\
  \
  Also, they should make use of OpenAI's LLM 
  with the environment variable. \
  \
  First let's discuss this and plan it out

⏺ I'll help you create a comprehensive Jupyter
  Notebook tutorial for the framework's process
   classes. Let me first explore the codebase
  to understand the current structure and then
  plan out the tutorial.

⏺ Task(Explore framework structure)
  ⎿  Done (12 tool uses · 45.5k tokens · 58.9s)

⏺ Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive
  plan for the LLM process tutorial. Based on
  my analysis, I can see this is a
  well-structured framework with excellent LLM
  integration capabilities.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿ ☐ Plan tutorial structure and learning     
      progression
    ☐ Design hands-on examples for each
      process type
    ☐ Create sample data and prompts for LLM
      interactions
    ☐ Structure Jupyter notebook with clear
      sections

⏺ Tutorial Plan: "Building LLM-Powered 
  Processes with Dachi"

  Here's my comprehensive plan for a
  progressive Jupyter Notebook tutorial:

  Tutorial Structure & Learning Progression

  Part 1: Foundation (Process)
  - Objective: Understand basic synchronous LLM
   processing
  - Example: Text summarization processor
  - Key Concepts:
    - @signaturemethod decorator for LLM
  integration
    - OpenAI ChatCompletion engine setup
    - Environment variable management

  Part 2: Asynchronous Processing 
  (AsyncProcess)
  - Objective: Scale to async operations for
  better performance
  - Example: Sentiment analysis with multiple
  documents
  - Key Concepts:
    - Converting sync to async patterns
    - aforward() method implementation
    - Performance benefits demonstration

  Part 3: Streaming Responses (StreamProcess)
  - Objective: Real-time processing with
  incremental results
  - Example: Progressive document analysis with
   status updates
  - Key Concepts:
    - stream() method yielding intermediate
  results
    - Progress tracking and user feedback
    - Iterator patterns

  Part 4: Advanced Streaming 
  (AsyncStreamProcess)
  - Objective: Combine async + streaming for
  maximum scalability
  - Example: Real-time multi-document
  processing pipeline
  - Key Concepts:
    - astream() with AsyncIterator
    - Parallel processing with
  async_process_map
    - Chunk class for data segmentation

  Part 5: Integration & Composition
  - Objective: Chain processes using Sequential
  - Example: Complete document processing
  pipeline
  - Key Concepts:
    - Process composition patterns
    - Error handling across pipeline stages
    - Real-world application architecture

  Hands-On Example Progression

  1. Simple Text Processor → Summarize single
  text
  2. Batch Document Analyzer → Process multiple
   documents async
  3. Real-time Content Processor → Stream
  processing updates
  4. Scalable Analysis Pipeline → Async
  streaming with chunking
  5. Complete Workflow → Multi-stage pipeline
  with all patterns

  Tutorial Features

  ✅ Interactive Code Cells - Each concept with
   runnable examples
  ✅ Progressive Complexity - Build from simple
   to advanced
  ✅ Real OpenAI Integration - Uses environment
   variables
  ✅ Performance Comparisons - Show sync vs
  async vs streaming benefits✅ Error Handling
  - Production-ready patterns
  ✅ Best Practices - Framework conventions and
   optimization tips

  Would you like me to proceed with creating
  this Jupyter Notebook tutorial? The structure
   will make it easy for LLMs and developers to
   gradually learn each process type through
  practical, working examples.

> The main purpose of this is not to introduce 
  LLMs but to show how to use Dachi. This 
  tutorial won't be that interesting but it 
  should focus on what we can do with dachi. \
  \
  It looks like you might be trying to do too 
  much\
  \
  Let's focus on 1) the core process classes, 
  2) parallelizing them with dachi's methods 
  for parallelization

⏺ You're absolutely right! Let me refocus on
  the core Dachi framework capabilities rather
  than getting caught up in LLM applications.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿ ☐ Plan focused tutorial: core process      
      classes + parallelization
    ☐ Design simple examples showing each
      process type
    ☐ Demonstrate Dachi's parallelization
      methods (async_process_map, Chunk)
    ☐ Create Jupyter notebook with focused,
      practical examples

⏺ Simplified Tutorial Plan: "Core Dachi 
  Framework"

  Tutorial Focus

  - Core: The 4 process classes and their
  patterns
  - Parallelization: Dachi's async_process_map
  and Chunk for scaling

  Structure (Much Simpler)

  Section 1: Process
  - Basic synchronous processing
  - Example: Simple text transformation
  (uppercase, word count, etc.)
  - When to use: Single input → single output

  Section 2: AsyncProcess
  - Same logic, async execution
  - Example: Same transformation, but async
  - When to use: I/O bound operations, better
  concurrency

  Section 3: StreamProcess
  - Yielding intermediate results
  - Example: Processing a list, yielding each
  result
  - When to use: Large datasets, progress
  tracking

  Section 4: AsyncStreamProcess
  - Async + streaming combined
  - Example: Async processing with streaming
  results
  - When to use: Best of both worlds

  Section 5: Parallelization
  - Using async_process_map with Chunk
  - Example: Take any of the above processes
  and run them in parallel
  - When to use: Scale processing across
  multiple items

  Simple Examples

  - Data: Just lists of text or numbers
  - Operations: Basic transformations (not
  LLM-heavy)
  - Focus: Show the framework patterns, not
  complex use cases

  This keeps it focused on how Dachi works
  rather than what you can build with it.
  Should I create this streamlined Jupyter
  notebook?

  processing like Chunk, reduce, multiprocess 
  and so on.
